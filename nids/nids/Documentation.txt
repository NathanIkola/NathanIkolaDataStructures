////////////////////////[ nids::vector ]
============================[ Overview ]
	The nids::vector is an attempt at creating an
alternative for the std::vector that does not use
any of the C++ exception functionality; instead,
nids::vector uses asserts to enforce that values
are within expected range (no nullptr after malloc,
indexes are all within range of vector size, etc...).
Additionally, nids::vector uses malloc, realloc, and
free to manage memory versus free and delete.

======================[ Design Choices ]
push_back:
	The push_back methods are NOT guaranteed to be 
	safe for use with variable references that come 
	from within the vector (i.e. v.push_back(v[0])).
	If the vector resizes on a push_back call which
	uses a reference to the vector's interal array,
	the address initially passed in isn't guaranteed
	to be the same after the resize has taken place.
	
	To have safe behavior, use the push_back_i
	method, which accepts internal references and
	caches the array index that corresponds to the
	value passed if the array is resizes, so that
	it can always reference the correct value.

///////////////[ nids::vector_iterator ]
============================[ Overview ]
	The nids::vector_iterator is the custom
iterator designed to iterate over nids::vector.

======================[ Design Choices ]
end:
	It is not legal to operate on nids::vector_iterator
	objects when their m_vector value is set to nullptr.
	Outside of the class itself, the only way to legally 
	get nullptr in m_vector is through destruction, move 
	operators, through iteration, or through the end() 
	method. Specifically, since it is illegal to operate 
	on these vectors, I have reserved m_vector == nullptr 
	to signify the end of the vector.

	To enforce this behavior, when the consumer calls the
	increment operator or next() and the iterator is at the
	end of the vector, it sets its m_vector variable to
	nullptr, so that comparisons for the end of the vector
	can take place.
